          <p>Women experience many kinds of disadvantage and discrimination in health, education and employment. To highlight these disparities, this Report presents HDI values separately for women and men for 148 countries. Worldwide the female HDI value averages about 8 percent lower than the male HDI value. Among regions, the largest gap is in South Asia (17 percent). The gap is small (3 percent) in the very high human development group but about 17 percent in the low human development group. Slovakia has achieved gender parity, while female HDI values are slightly higher than male values in 15 countries.</p>
          <p>The Gender Inequality Index for 149 countries reveals the extent to which national achievements in reproductive health, empowerment and labour market participation are eroded by gender inequality. Unlike the HDI, a higher Gender Inequality Index value indicates poor performance. Values range from an average of 0.317 for Europe and Central Asia to 0.575 for Sub-­Saharan Africa and from an average of 0.197 for the very high human development group to 0.586 for the low human development group. Slovenia outperforms all other countries (0.021), while Yemen has the highest value (0.733).</p>
          <p>Globally, women are disadvantaged in national political representation. On average, they occupy 21 percent of seats in national parliaments. In Latin America and the Caribbean they do better, with around 25 percent of seats. In Arab States parliaments they hold less than 14 percent of seats.</p>

        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
          <p>Poor reproductive health services are a major contributor to gender inequality, especially in developing countries. For example, the maternal mortality ratio is 474 deaths per 100,000 live births in Sub-­Saharan Africa. Maternal deaths naturally have serious implications for babies and their older siblings left without maternal care, who could be trapped in low human development throughout their life cycle. Adolescent births could also lead to debilitating human development outcomes for young mothers and their babies. In Sub-­Saharan Africa there are 110 births per 1,000 women ages 15–19.</p>
          <p>The deficits in education are wide as well. On average, 60 percent of women ages 25 and older have at least some secondary education, compared with 67  percent of men. This discrepancy is particularly large for the low human development group (15 percent versus 29 percent). And South Asia has the largest gender gap in education (15 percentage points). The very high human development group has near gender parity at this level (about 86  percent versus 88 percent).</p>
          <p>Women also lag behind men in labour market participation (51 percent compared with 77 percent). The situation is less promising for women in the Arab States, where 25 percent of women of working age participate in the labour market, compared with 73 percent of men. Labour force participation rates tend to be higher among women in Sub-­Saharan Africa because women are more often than not forced to eke a living in the informal sector.</p>
